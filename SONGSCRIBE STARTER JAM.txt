Key: C major
Tempo: 92 BPM

[Verse 1]
C            G
I hum a tune, and you catch the key,
Am            F
You find the chords that work for me.
C            G
I jot down words, just half a line,
Am            F
You help me shape it, keepin' time.

[Chorus]
C            G
SongScribe — my pocket bandmate,
Am            F
Tracks my voice and sets the slate.
C            G
Chord by chord and rhyme by rhyme,
Am            F
Makes my brainstorm feel sublime.

[Bridge — Feature Breakdown]
Dm          G
Record your melody — just press “Mic”,
Em          Am
Auto-chords kick in — it’s just right.
F            G
Tap the fretboard, write with ease,
C            G
Lyrics snap to beats like a breeze.

[Outro]
C            G
Organize by folder, tag your part,
Am            F
Export your lines, and share your heart.
C            G
From spark to song, you’re not alone—
Am            F
With SongScribe, you’re always home.
