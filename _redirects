# Cloudflare Pages redirects configuration
# https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/redirects/

# Note: Cloudflare Pages automatically serves HTML files without .html extension
# So /terms serves terms.html and /privacy serves privacy.html by default

# Redirect www to non-www (optional - configure based on your domain setup)
# https://www.songscribe.app/* https://songscribe.app/:splat 301

# Redirect /tuner paths to tuner subdomain (handled by middleware, not here)
# Moved to functions/_middleware.js to avoid interfering with ASSETS fetch

# Single Page App routing (if needed in future)
# /*  /index.html   200

# Legacy GitHub Pages redirect (if users have old links)
# /index.html   /   301
